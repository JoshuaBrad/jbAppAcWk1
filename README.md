##Notes::

The main page of a website is ALWAYS named "index.html"

A general practice is to have a style sheet in a separate page and link to it in the html document. It's usually called style.css but it doesn't have to be.

For the basics intro, such as what HTML is, etc, etc..... go read it from the website!
